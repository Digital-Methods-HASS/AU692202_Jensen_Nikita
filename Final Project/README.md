# Cold War and Nuclear Weapons

Author: Nikita Cecilie Jensen

This project will examine the Cold War and the proliferation of nuclear weapons from the period following the World War II to present time, 1945 – 2020. I'll take a closer look at how thinking about these weapons has evolved before, during and after the Cold War. I will do this through visualizations made in RStudio. This may contribute to an understanding of how the thinking about nuclear weapons has changed from the 1930s to today.

## 1. Data Acquisition and Processing:
This project is based on the data sources provided by [OurWorldInData project]: https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons.

### 1.1. Nuclear Weapons Status data:
I have used a data source (Nuclear Weapons Status) from Our World in Data to research the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Here is a more specific link to where I found it: https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons#nuclear-powers-and-proliferation. See this for more information about the data on nuclear weapon proliferation. The information includes that the data source is based on Bleek (2017) and Nuclear Threat Initiative (2022). Under sources it is described that the data is published by Our World in Data, Bastian Herre.

### 1.2. Nuclear Weapons Testing data:
The other data source (Nuclear Weapons Testing) used in this study is also provided by Our World In Data: https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons#nuclear-weapons-tests. This link provides more information specified about the data. This data source provides the number of nuclear weapons testing by country. The data is published by Arms Control Association. Here is a more specific link: https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/nucleartesttally. 

This data can also be found on Bastian Herre’s Github:

The data used in this project have not been cleaned by me.
